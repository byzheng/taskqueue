Description: Task Queue is implemented in R for asynchronous tasks based on 
             'PostgreSQL' <https://www.postgresql.org/> database to deal with 
             uneven load balance among workers and utilise new available workers. 
             This package is only suitable for parallel computing without 
             any communication among parallel tasks and to distribute asynchronous tasks
             to multiple workers.
