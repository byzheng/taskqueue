Description: Implements a task queue system for asynchronous parallel computing 
    using 'PostgreSQL' <https://www.postgresql.org/> as a backend. Designed for 
    embarrassingly parallel problems where tasks do not communicate with each other.
    Dynamically distributes tasks to workers, handles uneven load balancing, and 
    allows new workers to join at any time. Particularly useful for running large 
    numbers of independent tasks on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters with 
    'SLURM' job schedulers.
