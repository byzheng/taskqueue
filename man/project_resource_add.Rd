\usage{
project_resource_add(
  project,
  resource,
  working_dir,
  account = NULL,
  hours = 1,
  workers = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{Character string specifying the project name.}

\item{resource}{Character string specifying the resource name.}

\item{working_dir}{Absolute path to the working directory on the resource
where workers will execute.}

\item{account}{Optional character string for the account/allocation to use
on the resource (relevant for SLURM clusters with accounting). Default is NULL.}

\item{hours}{Maximum runtime in hours for each worker job. Default is 1 hour.}

\item{workers}{Maximum number of concurrent workers for this project on this
resource. If NULL, uses the resource's maximum worker count.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. Called for side effects (adding/updating
  project-resource association).
}
\description{
Associates a computing resource with a project and configures resource-specific
settings like working directory, runtime limits, and worker count.
}
\details{
This function creates or updates the association between a project and resource.
Each project can be associated with multiple resources, and settings are
resource-specific.

If the project-resource association already exists, only the specified
parameters are updated.

The \code{working_dir} should exist on the resource and contain any necessary
input files or scripts.

The \code{hours} parameter sets the SLURM walltime for worker jobs. Workers
will automatically terminate before this limit to avoid being killed mid-task.
