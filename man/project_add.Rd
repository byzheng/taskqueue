\title{Create a New Project}
\usage{
project_add(project, memory = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{Character string for the project name. Must be unique and
cannot be a reserved name (e.g., "config").}

\item{memory}{Memory requirement in gigabytes (GB) for each task in this
project. Default is 10 GB.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. Called for side effects (creating project in database).
}
\description{
Creates a new project in the database for managing a set of related tasks.
Each project has its own task table and configuration.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
  \item Creates a new entry in the \code{project} table
  \item Creates a dedicated task table named \code{task_<project>}
  \item Sets default memory requirements for all tasks
}

If a project with the same name already exists, the memory requirement is
updated but the task table remains unchanged.

After creating a project, you must:
\enumerate{
  \item Assign resources with \code{\link{project_resource_add}}
  \item Add tasks with \code{\link{task_add}}
  \item Start the project with \code{\link{project_start}}
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create a project with default memory
project_add("simulation_study")

# Create with higher memory requirement
project_add("big_data_analysis", memory = 64)

# Verify project was created
project_list()
}
}
