\title{Reset a Project}
\usage{
project_reset(project, log_clean = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{Character string specifying the project name.}

\item{log_clean}{Logical indicating whether to delete log files. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. Called for side effects (resetting tasks and logs).
}
\description{
Resets all tasks in a project to idle status, stops the project, and
optionally cleans log files. Useful for restarting a project from scratch.
}
\details{
This function performs three operations:
\enumerate{
  \item Resets all tasks to idle status (NULL) using \code{\link{task_reset}}
  \item Stops the project using \code{\link{project_stop}}
  \item Optionally deletes all log files from resource log folders
}

Use this when you want to:
\itemize{
  \item Restart failed tasks
  \item Re-run all tasks after fixing code
  \item Clean up before redeploying workers
}

\strong{Warning:} Setting \code{log_clean = TRUE} permanently deletes all
log files, which may contain useful debugging information.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Reset project and clean logs
project_reset("simulation_study")

# Reset but keep logs for debugging
project_reset("simulation_study", log_clean = FALSE)

# Restart after reset
project_start("simulation_study")
worker_slurm("simulation_study", "hpc", fun = my_function)
}
