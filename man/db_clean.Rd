\title{Clean All Tables and Definitions from Database}
\usage{
db_clean()
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. Called for side effects (dropping database objects).
}
\description{
Removes all taskqueue-related tables, types, and data from the PostgreSQL
database. This is a destructive operation that cannot be undone.
}
\details{
This function drops:
\itemize{
  \item All project task tables
  \item The \code{project_resource} table
  \item The \code{project} table
  \item The \code{resource} table
  \item All custom types (e.g., \code{task_status})
}

\strong{Warning:} This permanently deletes all projects, tasks, and configurations.
Use with extreme caution, typically only for testing or complete resets.

After cleaning, you must call \code{\link{db_init}} to recreate the schema
before using taskqueue again.
