\description{
Deactivates a project and cancels all running SLURM jobs associated with it.
Workers will terminate after completing their current task.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
  \item Sets the project status to FALSE, preventing workers from taking new tasks
  \item Cancels all SLURM jobs associated with this project using \code{scancel}
  \item Resets the job list for all project resources
}

in \code{working} status when the project stops should be reset to \code{idle}
using \code{\link{project_reset}} or \code{\link{task_reset}}.
}

# Stop project and cancel all jobs
